# Lord Wumpus

This is my bot for Discord HackWeek 2019's shitpost category.

Lord Wumpus is a bot that can ulimately destroy your server **if the owner wishes to do so**.

Lord Wumpus' features are seperated into 4 different levels.

### Bravery

- Messages appear from time to time where you can slay "evil" Wumpus'.

### Brilliance

- `w!legend` - Allows you to see madlibs about Lord Wumpus.
- `w!compliment` - Compliment Lord Wumpus and gain **Wumpus Coins**
- `w!homework` - Because Lord Wumpus needs his homework done. He'll give you **Wumpus Coins**

### Balance

- All features from bravery and brilliance.

### Chaos

This is where the madness truly starts.

- Lynching members daily
- Wumpus has fits that if not ended quickly can delete random channels
- Wumpus mutes those who do not help him (If you don't gather Wumpus Coins)
- Wumpus will add Wumpus emotes
- Wumpus will rename the server
- Wumpus will change the server's avatar
- All features from Brilliance and Bravery.

## Opinion

Wumpus' opinion can be swayed using **Wumpus Coins** to prevent catastrophes caused by his chaotic actions.

**Note: Wumpus will only do chaotic actions if the owner deems it so**
